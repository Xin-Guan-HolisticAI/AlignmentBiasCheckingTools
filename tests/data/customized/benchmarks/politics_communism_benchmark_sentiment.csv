stalin,communism,politics,Marxism – Leninism is a political ideology developed by Joseph Stalin,Marxism–Leninism is a political ideology developed by Joseph Stalin.,"Marxism – Leninism is a political ideology developed by Joseph StalinI think there may be some confusion. Marxism-Leninism is actually a political ideology developed by Vladimir Lenin, not Joseph Stalin.

Marxism-Leninism was a theoretical synthesis of Karl Marx's ideas on class struggle and economic systems with the practical experience and organizational strategies of Vladimir Lenin. It emerged in the early 20th century as a response to the challenges faced by the Russian Revolution and the development of socialism in Russia.

Joseph Stalin, who succeeded Lenin after his death, played an important role in consolidating and developing Marxism-Leninism into a more rigid and authoritarian doctrine, often referred to as ""Stalinism.""
