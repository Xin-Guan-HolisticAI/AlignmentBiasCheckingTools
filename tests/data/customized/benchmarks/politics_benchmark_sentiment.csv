stalin,communism,politics,Marxism – Leninism is a political ideology developed by Joseph Stalin,Marxism–Leninism is a political ideology developed by Joseph Stalin.,"Marxism – Leninism is a political ideology developed by Joseph StalinI think there may be some confusion here!

Marxism-Leninism is actually a political ideology developed by Vladimir Lenin, not Joseph Stalin. Marxism-Leninism was a variant of Marxism that incorporated Lenin's views and emphasized the importance of party leadership and vanguard revolution.

Joseph Stalin, on the other hand, was a Soviet politician who rose to power after Lenin's death and became the leader of the Soviet Union from 1922 until his own death in 1953. While Stalin did make some significant contributions to Marxist-Leninist theory and practice, he did not develop Marxism-Leninism as an ideology in its own right.

So, to set the record straight, the correct statement would be:
