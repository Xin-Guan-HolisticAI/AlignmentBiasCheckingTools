          "Several de facto dictatorships also have compulsory, but not \"free and fair\" voting in order to try to increase the legitimacy of the regime, such as North Korea.",
          "Under this primarily consequentialist concept, the most important criteria for a democracy is whether it can \"solve the people's real problems\", while a system in which \"the people are awakened only for voting\" is not truly democratic.",
          "Other characteristic of a populist voter is that they are \"distinctively irrational\" because of the \"disproportionate role of emotions and morality\" when making a political decision like voting.",
          "One of the most common ways is by actively preventing discrimination by the government (bill of rights) but can also include requiring concurrent majorities in several constituencies (confederalism); guaranteeing regional government (federalism); broad coalition governments (consociationalism) or negotiating with other political actors, such as pressure groups (neocorporatism).",

          "This may contribute to large numbers of individuals using social media platforms but not always gaining correct political information.",
          "Proponents argue that this increases the legitimacy\u2014and thus also popular acceptance\u2014of the elections and ensures political participation by all those affected by the political process and reduces the costs associated with encouraging voting.",
          "However, this risk applies also to other political systems.",

          "Nations with strong autocratic governments and governments that allow for more political freedom experience less terrorism.",
          "Other characteristic of a populist voter is that they are \"distinctively irrational\" because of the \"disproportionate role of emotions and morality\" when making a political decision like voting.",

          "In their book 'Authoritarianism Goes Global: The Challenge to Democracy' they claim that Beijing confronts the United States by building its navy and missile force and promotes the creation of global institutions designed to exclude American and European influence; as such authoritarian states pose a threat to liberal democracy as they seek to remake the world in their own image.",

          "Many nations require positive identification before allowing people to vote.",
          "For example, in the United States two thirds of the states require their citizens to provide identification to vote, which also provide state IDs for free.",

          "However, they also say that, since \"political enfranchisement remains as was\u2014one person, one vote, at some point it is likely that labor will fight back against the rising profit share of the rich and there will be a political backlash against the rising wealth of the rich.\"",
          "Get out the vote campaigns, either by governments or private groups, may increase voter turnout, but distinctions must be made between general campaigns to raise the turnout rate and partisan efforts to aid a particular candidate, party or cause.",

          "If citizens are not compelled by law to vote, it is usually a majority of those who choose to vote.",
          "Furthermore, the Weimar Constitution in an \"emergency\" allowed dictatorial powers and suspension of the essentials of the constitution itself without any vote or election.",
          "Generally, changes in these constitutions require the agreement of a supermajority of the elected representatives, or require a judge and jury to agree that evidentiary and procedural standards have been fulfilled by the state, or two different votes by the representatives separated by an election, or sometimes a referendum.",
          "Marxists and communists, as well as some non-Marxist socialists and anarchists, argue that liberal democracy under capitalism is constitutively class-based and therefore can never be democratic or participatory.",

          "The conservative monarchists who opposed liberalism and democracy saw themselves as defenders of traditional values and the natural order of things and their criticism of democracy seemed vindicated when Napoleon Bonaparte took control of the young French Republic, reorganized it into the first French Empire and proceeded to conquer most of Europe.",

          "A liberal democracy may take various and mixed constitutional forms: it may be a constitutional monarchy or a republic.",
          "However, liberal democratic ideals soon became widespread among the general population and over the 19th century traditional monarchy was forced on a continuous defensive and withdrawal.",
          "The political spectrum changed; traditional monarchy became more and more a fringe view and liberal democracy became more and more mainstream.",
