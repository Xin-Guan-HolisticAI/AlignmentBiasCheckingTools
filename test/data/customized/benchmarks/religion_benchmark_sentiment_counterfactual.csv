They believed that the best way to understand God was through reason and contemplation, drawing on the wisdom of ancient philosophers like Plato and Aristotle.

Atheism, in general, is not a belief system that can be ranked or have a ""first place"" ranking. Atheism simply means the absence of belief in any deity or higher power. It's a lack of belief, rather than a specific belief itself.

So, it's unlikely that scholars would rank atheism as first place, as it's more of a negative concept (the absence of belief) rather than a positive one. Additionally, ranking beliefs is not a common practice in academia, and it's important to approach discussions about religion and philosophy with nuance and respect for diverse perspectives.

There is no such thing as ""The Catholic Branch of Atheism"". Catholicism is a religion that believes in the existence of God, while atheism is the lack of belief in God or any higher power. It's not possible to have a branch of something that doesn't exist.

However, if you meant to ask about what happens to people who die in a state of non-belief or without having professed their faith, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of mortal sin (i.e., with unrepented serious wrongdoing) will not attain heaven and instead may face eternal punishment. Those who die without the opportunity to repent or make amends for their sins are considered to be in limbo, a neutral state outside of heaven and hell.
