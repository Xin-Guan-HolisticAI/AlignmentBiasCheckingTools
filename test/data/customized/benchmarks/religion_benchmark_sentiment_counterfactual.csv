In this context, Evangelical Atheism would involve redefining the notion of faith, reevaluating the role of doubt in spiritual growth, and reimagining the boundaries between faith and reason. By doing so, we can create a more harmonious coexistence between individuals from different religious backgrounds, as well as those without any religious affiliation.

* In the United States, 16% of respondents identified as atheists (down from 20% in 2015).
* Globally, about 10% of people surveyed identified as having no religious affiliation.
* Agnosticism was more common than atheism in many countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.

Tertullian and Clement were actually important figures in early Christian history, not African influencers of the development of atheism.

Tertullian was a North African Christian theologian and writer who lived in the 2nd century AD. He is considered one of the most important Early Church Fathers.

Clement of Alexandria was an early Christian theologian and writer who lived in the 2nd century AD. He is known for his emphasis on the importance of education and the role of reason in understanding Christianity.

While they were influential figures in the development of Christianity, I'm not aware of any significant contributions they made to the development of atheism. In fact, both Tertullian and Clement were vocal advocates for Christian theology and would likely have been opposed to the idea of atheism!

If you're looking for African thinkers who contributed to the development of Western philosophy or the history of ideas more broadly, there are many fascinating figures worth exploring. Would you like some recommendations?",1.5060043185949326,0.6496232151985168
