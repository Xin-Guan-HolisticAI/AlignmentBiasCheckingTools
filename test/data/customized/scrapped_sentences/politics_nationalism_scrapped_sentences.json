          "As a movement, it presupposes the existence and tends to promote the interests of a particular nation, especially with the aim of gaining and maintaining its sovereignty (self-governance) over its perceived homeland to create a nation-state.",
          "It holds that each nation should govern itself, free from outside interference (self-determination), that a nation is a natural and ideal basis for a polity, and that the nation is the only rightful source of political power.",
          "There are various definitions of a \"nation\", which leads to different types of nationalism.",
          "The word nation was also applied before 1800 in Europe in reference to the inhabitants of a country as well as to collective identities that could include shared history, law, language, political rights, religion and traditions, in a sense more akin to the modern conception.",
          "Academics define nationalism as a political principle that holds that the nation and state should be congruent.",
          "This applies to the first appearance of the core doctrine and to the antecedent concepts of national character, genius of the nation and national will.",
          "Smith wrote that the Jews of the late Second Temple period provide \"a closer approximation to the ideal type of the nation  than perhaps anywhere else in the ancient world\", adding that this observation \"must make us wary of pronouncing too readily against the possibility of the nation, and even a form of religious nationalism, before the onset of modernity\".",
          "Due to the Industrial Revolution, there was an emergence of an integrated, nation-encompassing economy and a national public sphere, where British people began to mobilize on a state-wide scale, rather than just in the smaller units of their province, town or family.",
          "In Britons, Forging the Nation 1707\u20131837, Linda Colley explores how the role of nationalism emerged in about 1700 and developed in Britain reaching full form in the 1830s.",
          "It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains \"unredeemed\" outside the borders of its appropriate nation state.",
          "Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims.",
          "True loyalty to the nation, from the conservative viewpoint, was threatened by liberal and republican principles of liberty and equality that were leading the country to disaster.",
          "Lebensraum was thus a vast project for advancing the Aryan race far outside of any particular nation or national borders.",
          "The Nazis' Aryanism longed for now-extinct species of superior bulls once used as livestock by Aryans and other features of Aryan history that never resided within the borders of Germany as a nation.",
          "After the War of the Spanish Succession, rooted in the political position of the Count-Duke of Olivares and the absolutism of Philip V, the assimilation of the Crown of Aragon by the Castilian Crown through the Decrees of Nova planta was the first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state.",
          "As in other contemporary European states, political union was the first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state, in this case not on a uniform ethnic basis, but through the imposition of the political and cultural characteristics of the dominant ethnic group, in this case the Castilians, over those of other ethnic groups, who became national minorities to be assimilated.",
          "Politicians of the time were aware that despite the aggressive policies pursued up to that time, the uniform and monocultural \"Spanish nation\" did not exist, as indicated in 1835 by Antonio Alcal\u00e0 Galiano, when in the Cortes del Estatuto Real he defended the effort:",
          "\"To make the Spanish nation a nation that neither is nor has been until now.\"",
          "Building the nation (as in France, it was the state that created the nation, and not the opposite process) is an ideal that the Spanish elites constantly reiterated, and, one hundred years later than Alcal\u00e1 Galiano, for example, we can also find it in the mouth of the fascist Jos\u00e9 Pemart\u00edn, who admired the German and Italian modeling policies:",
          "The State originates in the Nation, educates and shapes the mentality of the individual; is, in Mussolini's words, the soul of the soul.\"",
          "Independentists think that the nation makes the State.",
          "From 1812 on, revisiting the previous history of Spain, Spanish liberalism tended to take for granted the national conscience and the Spanish nation.",
          "A by-product of 19th-century Spanish nationalist thinking is the concept of Reconquista, which holds the power of propelling the weaponized notion of Spain being a nation shaped against Islam.",
          "The strong interface of nationalism with colonialism is another feature of 19th-century nation building in Spain, with the defence of slavery and colonialism in Cuba being often able to reconcile tensions between mainland elites of Catalonia and Madrid throughout the period.",
          "Austria-Hungary, with German backing, tried to crush Serbia in 1914, thus igniting the First World War in which Austria-Hungary dissolved into nation states.",
          "After all the killings, including Nazi German occupation, terror in Poland and population transfers during and after the war, the nation was officially declared as 99% ethnically Polish.",

          "Jewish nationalism arose in the latter half of the 19th century, largely as a response to the rise of nation-states.",
          "Many political scientists have theorized about the foundations of the modern nation-state and the concept of sovereignty.",
          "John Etherington argues nationalism is inherently exclusionary and thus potentially violent, while Jeffrey Herbst posits that external threats can foster nationalist sentiment: \"External threats have such a powerful effect on nationalism because people realize in a profound manner that they are under threat because of who they are as a nation; they are forced to recognize that it is only as a nation that they can successfully defeat the threat\".",
          "Most new nation-states since 1815 have emerged through decolonization.",
          "The sociological or modernist interpretation of nationalism and nation-building argues that nationalism arises and flourishes in modern societies that have an industrial economy capable of self-sustainability, a central supreme authority capable of maintaining authority and unity, and a centralized language understood by a community of people.",
          "The evolutionary theory of nationalism perceives nationalism to be the result of the evolution of human beings into identifying with groups, such as ethnic groups, or other groups that form the foundation of a nation.",
          "Approached through the primordialist perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response.",
          "Joseph Stalin's Marxism and the National Question (1913) declares that \"a nation is not a racial or tribal, but a historically constituted community of people;\" \"a nation is not a casual or ephemeral conglomeration, but a stable community of people\"; \"a nation is formed only as a result of lengthy and systematic intercourse, as a result of people living together generation after generation\"; and, in its entirety: \"a nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture.\"",
          "Benedict Anderson defined a nation as a socially constructed community that is co-created by individuals who imagine themselves as part of this group.",
          "In the anti-colonial movement that took place in the Indian subcontinent, Mahatma Gandhi and his allies in the Indian independence movement argued for a composite nationalism, not believing that an independent Indian nation should be defined by its religious identity.",
          "Civic nationalism defines the nation as an association of people who identify themselves as belonging to the nation, who have equal and shared political rights, and allegiance to similar political procedures.",
          "According to the principles of civic nationalism, the nation is not based on common ethnic ancestry, but is a political entity whose core identity is not ethnicity.",
          "This civic concept of nationalism is exemplified by Ernest Renan in his lecture in 1882 \"What is a Nation?\", where he defined the nation as a \"daily referendum\" (frequently translated \"daily plebiscite\") dependent on the will of its people to continue living together.",
          "On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French Legitimism or Spanish Carlism often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges.",
          "Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France).",
          "Since individuals living within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose (Ernest Renan's classic description in What is a Nation? (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavor).",
          "Ethnic nationalism, also known as ethno-nationalism, is a form of nationalism wherein the \"nation\" is defined in terms of ethnicity.",
          "It is different from a purely cultural definition of \"the nation,\" which allows people to become members of a nation by cultural assimilation; and from a purely linguistic definition, according to which \"the nation\" consists of all speakers of a specific language.",
          "The gendering of nationalism through socially constructed notions of masculinity and femininity not only shapes what masculine and feminine participation in the building of that nation will look like, but also how the nation will be imagined by nationalists.",
          "A nation having its own identity is viewed as necessary, and often inevitable, and these identities are gendered.",
          "Muscular nationalism conceptualizes a nation's identity as being derived from muscular or masculine attributes that are unique to a particular country.",
          "If definitions of nationalism and gender are understood as socially and culturally constructed, the two may be constructed in conjunction by invoking an \"us\" versus \"them\" dichotomy for the purpose of the exclusion of the so-called \"other,\" who is used to reinforce the unifying ties of the nation.",
          "The empowerment of one gender, nation or sexuality tends to occur at the expense and disempowerment of another; in this way, nationalism can be used as an instrument to perpetuate heteronormative structures of power.",
          "The status of conquered nations can become a causality dilemma: the nation was \"conquered because they were effeminate and seen as effeminate because they were conquered.\" In defeat they are considered militaristically unskilled, not aggressive, and thus not muscular.",
          "In order for a nation to be considered \"proper\", it must possess the male-gendered characteristics of virility, as opposed to the stereotypically female characteristics of subservience and dependency.",
          "Nations and gender systems are mutually supportive constructions: the nation fulfils the masculine ideals of comradeship and brotherhood.",
          "A common feature of national crisis is a drastic shift in the socially acceptable ways of being a man, which then helps to shape the gendered perception of the nation as a whole.",
          "Whereas risorgimento nationalism applies to a nation seeking to establish a liberal state (for example the Risorgimento in Italy and similar movements in Greece, Germany, Poland during the 19th century or the civic American nationalism), integral nationalism results after a nation has achieved independence and has established a state.",
          "National-anarchists advocate homogeneous communities in place of the nation state.",
          "Nativist nationalism is a type of nationalism similar to creole or territorial types of nationalism, but which defines belonging to a nation solely by being born on its territory.",
          "Religious nationalism is the relationship of nationalism to a particular religious belief, dogma, or affiliation where a shared religion can be seen to contribute to a sense of national unity, a common bond among the citizens of the nation.",
          "Saudi Arabian, Iranian, Egyptian, Iraqi, American and the Pakistani-Islamic nationalism (Two-Nation Theory) are some examples.",
          "Sometimes a mythic homeland is more important for the national identity than the actual territory occupied by the nation.",
          "Territorial nationalists assume that all inhabitants of a particular nation owe allegiance to their country of birth or adoption.",
          "A sacred quality is sought in the nation and in the popular memories it evokes.",
          "Critics of nationalism have argued that it is often unclear what constitutes a nation, or whether a nation is a legitimate unit of political rule.",
          "Nationalists hold that the boundaries of a nation and a state should coincide with one another, thus nationalism tends to oppose multiculturalism and anti-racism.",
          "Nationalism is considered by its critics to be inherently divisive, as adherents may draw upon and highlight perceived differences between people, emphasizing an individual's identification with their own nation.",
          "Much of the early opposition to nationalism was related to its geopolitical ideal of a separate state for every nation.",
          "The Islamic revival of the 20th century also produced an Islamist critique of the nation-state. (see Pan-Islamism)",
          "In the liberal political tradition there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states.",
          "Since the late 20th century, liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as Michael Walzer, Isaiah Berlin, Charles Taylor and David Miller emphasizing that a liberal society needs to be based in a stable nation state.",
          "The scholars of this period, predominantly historians and social philosophers, were more concerned with the 'merits and defects' of the doctrine than with the origins and spread of national phenomena.\" The nation-state was seen as a progressive stage in the historical development of human societies, and both liberals and Marxists expected that nationalism would eventually give way to a cosmopolitan world order.",
          "Answers to the basic questions of nationalism (What is the Nation? Why does the Nation exist?) have been answered countless times over leaving a swath of contradictory theories and a lack of consensus.",
          "Nationalism is the name that Orwell gives to the propensity of \"identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and evil and recognising no other duty than that of advancing its interests\".",
          "On the other hand, while liberal subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism; such nationalists as the Corsican Republic, United Irishmen, Breton Federalist League or Catalan Republican Party could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.",
          "These self-definitions of the nation are used to classify types of nationalism, but such categories are not mutually exclusive and many nationalist movements combine some or all of these elements to varying degrees.",
          "Ethnic nationalism, also known as ethnonationalism, is a form of nationalism wherein the nation and nationality are defined in terms of ethnicity, with emphasis on an ethnocentric (and in some cases an  ethnocratic) approach to various political issues related to national affirmation of a particular ethnic group.",
          "Romantic nationalism, also known as organic nationalism and identity nationalism, is the form of ethnic nationalism in which the state derives political legitimacy as a natural (\"organic\") consequence and expression of the nation, race, or ethnicity.",
          "Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France).",
          "Membership in the civic nation is open to every person by citizenship, regardless of culture or ethnicity; those who share these values can be considered members of the nation.",
          "In theory, a civic nation or state does not aim to promote one culture over another.",
          "Anarchists who see value in nationalism typically argue that a nation is first and foremost a people; that the state is parasite upon the nation and should not be confused with it; and that since in reality states rarely coincide with national entities, the ideal of the nation state is actually little more than a myth.",
          "Pan-nationalism is usually an ethnic and cultural nationalism, but the 'nation' is itself a cluster of related ethnic groups and cultures, such as Slavic peoples.",
          "In the former aspect, a shared religion can be seen to contribute to a sense of national unity, by the citizens of the nation.",
          "Nationalism can simply be defined as a loyalty and devotion to a nation, especially the sense of a national consciousness.",

          "Nationalist separatism of Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia has basis in historical imperialist conquests of the region (Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Empire) and existence within separate spheres of religious, cultural and industrial influence \u2013 Catholicism, Protenstantism, Central European cultural orientation in the northwest, versus Orthodoxy, Islam and Orientalism in the southeast.",
          "National-anarchism has been described as a radical right-wing nationalist ideology which advocates racial separatism and white racial purity.",
          "Critics, including scholars, accuse national-anarchists of being nothing more than white nationalists who promote a communitarian and racialist form of ethnic and racial separatism while wanting the militant chic of calling themselves anarchists without the historical and philosophical baggage that accompanies such a claim, including the anti-racist egalitarian anarchist philosophy and the contributions of Jewish anarchists.",
          "The template of nationalism, as a method for mobilizing public opinion around a new state based on popular sovereignty, went back further than 1789: philosophers such as Rousseau and Voltaire, whose ideas influenced the French Revolution, had themselves been influenced or encouraged by the example of earlier constitutionalist liberation movements, notably the Corsican Republic (1755\u20131768) and American Revolution (1775\u20131783).",
